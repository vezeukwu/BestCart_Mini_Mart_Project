## Introduction
Best Cart Mini Marts have convenience retails stores in most gas stations in Great Britain. They sell a vast range of products at their stores which are relatively compact, and therefore, are limited in terms of how much stock they can carry.
This then poses a situation where products are overstocked and sometimes wasted as it produces a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions because more goods are produced, transported, and disposed off than necessary which in-turn increases the carbon footprint of the store.

## Problem Statement
Best Cart Mini Marts needs me as a data analyst to identify the right stocking mix for the next year having been provided with their previous year’s sales data to provide data-driven recommendations on the right stocking mix throughout the year ahead. The sales manager sent a note saying that not every product sells consistently at the same volume throughout the year, and some go through significant fluctuation over the year.
The presented data had a lot of quality issues including but not limited to data entry errors eg spelling mistakes, missing fields, same products being listed as different products due to inconsistent naming, and incorrect categorisation of products.

## Solution
The quality issues of the data were handled first, did a thorough cleaning and standardization of the provided data, removed duplicates, corrected spelling errors using Excel functions and formulars, then proceeded to analyse trends and pattern, visualizing them using various Excel charts.

•	Certain products eg Chocolate ice-cream sold more during summer while coffee sold very high all year round.

•	Certain brands eg All cigarette ltd were not sold at all throughout the year, while some sold more during summer

•	The highest selling products during winter and Spring are: Red Lines 405 and small chip 60g in the category of food and snacks

## Key insights and recommendations
•	£21.25M in Total Revenue with 6.60M Units Sold across various product categories.

•	A clear visualization of monthly sales trends, highlighting peak seasons from May to October. Regular Coffee and Grilled Cheese are the highest-selling products by quantity, while Blue Line and Red Line products generate the most revenue. 
Best Cart should prioritize maintaining a consistent stock of these items throughout the year, especially during peak sales months from May to October.

•	The Food category leads with over £10M in revenue, while Regular Coffee is the best-selling product by quantity.

•	Seasonal analysis reveals that Summer and Autumn generate the highest sales in both quantity and revenue. During Spring and Winter, sales tend to slow down. 
Best Cart should focus on stocking products that consistently sell well all-year-round (such as Regular Coffee and Snacks) while reducing stock levels of seasonal products that may contribute to wastage during off-peak periods.

•	Best Cart should focus on strengthening relationships with the manufacturers of Blue Line, Red Line, and high-demand Food Category products, particularly Grilled Cheese. By working more closely with these manufacturers, Best Cart can secure better deals, ensure product availability, and drive higher revenue.
